# Short Pitch: After U.S. arms were sold to Taiwan, how many did they send? 

## by Andrew Zi-Qi Fang, Northwestern University

*Why this story is timely now*

Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. noticed that it is still possible for any regime like China to annex Taiwan. During a late September hearing on Defense Cooperation with Taiwan, many of the committee members asked for a faster speed to send the weapons to the island under growing threats from Chinese President Xi. Rep. 


*Anything else important to know*

The U.S. government has approved arms sales to Taiwan over the past three decades. According to the U.S. Department of the State's [latest testimony](https://www.state.gov/house-armed-services-committee-hearing-defense-cooperation-with-taiwan/) on the hearing which the House Armed Services Committee Holds Hearing held, Deputy Mira Rensnick said the Biden administration authorized more than $21 billion in Taiwan arms sales to Congress. 


*What interesting question you want to answer*

Joe Wilson (R-SC) said on the hearing, "For all of the arms sales to Taiwan approved by the Department of State during the Biden administration, it seems that everything continues to be delayed." [A Washington lawmaker](https://www.reuters.com/world/us-lawmaker-says-washington-has-obligation-fulfil-military-sales-backlog-taiwan-2023-09-01/) also pointed out that the U.S. had an obligation to fill its backlog of arms sales to Taiwan. 

American military support to the Asian ally often considered done when the Capitol approved the bill. However, transfering the arms requires a long waiting for years, which might be difiicult to cope with the urgent need among the tensions across the Taiwan Strait. 

In the story I am pitching, I will display the timeline of the U.S. arm sales to Taiwan and illustrate the pace of each administration on the action. 


*What data may be available (or how you could collect your own dataset) to help you answer it*

While the arms sales bill are considered open to the public as other bills passed by the House and the Senate, the exact time when the U.S. manufacturer transfered the arms reqiures futher matching process to made. For the records obtains in the Washington, Department of State disclose those figures on [their website](https://www.state.gov/fiscal-year-2022-u-s-arms-transfers-and-defense-trade/) every fiscal year. 

On Taipei's side, official records from the [Minitry of National Defense](https://www.mnd.gov.tw/english/) can be collected. I will also trace down the stories on the transitions in the past from Taiwanese officail news outlets like the [Military News Agency](https://mna.gpwb.gov.tw/en/) and [Central News Agency](https://focustaiwan.tw/). 

The following websites or organizations also keep track on the arms sales made by U.S. 

* [Forum on the Arm Trade](https://www.forumarmstrade.org/)
* [Stockholm International Peace Research Institue](https://www.sipri.org/)
* [Counsil on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/podcasts/cost-us-arms-trade)

  
*What types of people you could talk to for sources*

My beat covering over the Capitol for my graduate program is focusing on national defense issues. I can access to both officials and think tanks in Washington, DC. Here are some possible sources: 

* [House Armed Service Committee](https://armedservices.house.gov/)
* [Senate Committee on Armed Service](https://www.armed-services.senate.gov/)
* Members of [House Taiwan Caucus](https://fapa.org/house-taiwan-caucus/)
* Members of [Senate Taiwan Caucus](https://fapa.org/senate-taiwan-caucus/)
