1. Write a short pitch, as you would in a note to an editor, for a story idea that could work for the class final project. This is NOT locking you in to this idea - this is just to get you thinking about ideas now. The pitch should (at least) cover:
	* What interesting question you want to answer
	* What data may be available (or how you could collect your own dataset) to help you answer it
	* Why this story is timely now
	* What types of people you could talk to for sources
	* Anything else important to know
1. Include at least one of the following features in either your critique or story pitch, to show you know how to use markdown:
   * A heading
   * A bulleted list
   * An ordered list 
   * A table
  
# Short Pitch: After U.S. arms were sold to Taiwan, how many did they send? 

*Why this story is timely now*

Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. noticed that it is still possible for any regime like China to annex Taiwan. 

*Anything else important to know*

The U.S. government has approved arms sales to Taiwan over the past three decades. According to the U.S. Department of the State's [latest testimony](https://www.state.gov/house-armed-services-committee-hearing-defense-cooperation-with-taiwan/) on the hearing on Defense Cooperation with Taiwan which the House Armed Services Committee Holds Hearing held, Deputy Mira Rensnick said the Biden administration authorized more than $21 billion in Taiwan arms sales to Congress. 

*What interesting question you want to answer*

During the hearing, many of the committee members asked for a faster speed to send the weapons to the island under growing threats from Chinese President Xi. Rep. Joe Wilson (R-SC) said, "For all of the arms sales to Taiwan approved by the Department of State during the Biden administration, it seems that everything continues to be delayed." [Another Washington lawmaker](https://www.reuters.com/world/us-lawmaker-says-washington-has-obligation-fulfil-military-sales-backlog-taiwan-2023-09-01/) also pointed out that the U.S. had an obligation to fill its backlog of arms sales to Taiwan.
