1. Department of State: Congressional Budget Justification
ðŸ”—[Congressional Budget Justification, Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs(FMF)](https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FY-2022-State_USAID-Congressional-Budget-Justification.pdf)

This report might not be specific, but it provides an overview of the proportion of the Department of State's funding to foreign countries. The figures relevant to my pitch about Taiwan were categorized under "East Asia and Pacific" and mostly did not specify Taiwan. An [Op-Ed](https://www.aei.org/op-eds/send-more-aid-to-taiwan-before-its-too-late/) of the think tank AEI pointed out that "Just 2 percent of the State Departmentâ€™s most recent FMF budget request was for East Asia and the Pacific. FMF funding for Taiwan should reflect its status as a critical partner in our primary theater and threatened by our pacing adversary."
