# Assignment 2: What's out there | Story research
## What has already been done? 

My story pitch is about the slow-paced transfer of Washington's arms sales to Taiwan. Some of the news stories pointed out this problem but made no further tracking. 

* Washington Post: [Taiwan frustrated by weapons delays, key lawmaker finds in stealth visit](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/02/22/taiwan-weapons-china-gallagher/)
* Defense News: [Taiwan is buying US weapons, but Washington isn‚Äôt delivering them](https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2022/08/25/chinas-neighbors-are-buying-us-weapons-washington-isnt-delivering/)

Some of the stories pointed out that the delay was caused by contractors including Lockheed Martin and Raytheon Technologies Corp (RTX). 

* Wall Street Journal: [U.S. Effort to Arm Taiwan Faces New Challenge With Ukraine Conflict](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-effort-to-arm-taiwan-faces-new-challenge-with-ukraine-conflict-11669559116)
* Defense News: [Slow arms deliveries to Taiwan blamed on US production bottlenecks](https://www.defensenews.com/pentagon/2023/02/24/slow-arms-deliveries-to-taiwan-blamed-on-us-production-bottlenecks/)

This explanation fits what Mira Resnick, a deputy assistant secretary of the Department of State, said in a September hearing. When congressmen asked about the delay in this hearing, Resnick claimed that the contractors caused the delay and that all they could do was push the pace. 

* The page of the hearing from the House Armed Services Committee [Full Committee Hearing: ‚ÄúDefense Cooperation with Taiwan‚Äù](https://armedservices.house.gov/hearings/full-committee-hearing-defense-cooperation-taiwan)
* Mira Resnick's report for the hearing [House Armed Services Committee Hearing: Defense Cooperation with Taiwan](https://www.state.gov/house-armed-services-committee-hearing-defense-cooperation-with-taiwan/)

By the way, the latest policy made by Washington was this bill. It authorized the President's power to aid Taiwan. This bill is also the reason why some American news outlets found it newsworthy. 

* The latest bill passed by the Congress about arms sales to Taiwan [H.R.7776 - James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/7776/text)

Overall, there is not much coverage with data or visualized information on the issue. I expect a rare chance to repeat what others have done. On the flip side, there might be a few pieces of information I can reach out to easily. 

As for Taipei's updates about the transfer of arms they purchased from the U.S., there isn't collective data or reports made by the officials. I viewed some Taipei think tanks I know but found a few clues. However, since it is rare and slow for American contractors and Washington to deliver the weapons,  I expect that I can track each of the deliveries at least in the past five to seven years. 

## Three high-quality datasets
*At least three*

1. Department of State: Congressional Budget Justification

üîó[Congressional Budget Justification, Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs(FMF)](https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FY-2022-State_USAID-Congressional-Budget-Justification.pdf)

This report might not be specific, but it provides an overview of the proportion of the Department of State's funding to foreign countries. The figures are relevant to my pitch about Taiwan were categorized under "East Asia and Pacific" and mostly did not specify Taiwan. An [Op-Ed](https://www.aei.org/op-eds/send-more-aid-to-taiwan-before-its-too-late/) of the think tank AEI pointed out that "Just 2 percent of the State Department‚Äôs most recent FMF budget request was for East Asia and the Pacific. FMF funding for Taiwan should reflect its status as a critical partner in our primary theater and threatened by our pacing adversary."

2. Forum on the Arms Trade: U.S. Arms Sales to Taiwan

üîó[U.S. Arms Sales to Taiwan](https://www.forumarmstrade.org/ustaiwan.html)

This page organizes clear timelines of the arms sales policies of Washington's arms sale to Taiwan. It contains information purely in texts, instead of data.

3. Taiwan's National Defense Report 2023

üîó[ROC National Defense Report 2023](https://www.mnd.gov.tw/newupload/ndr/112/112ndreng.pdf)

This annual report lays out the budget for purchasing arms from the United States. ROC refers to the Republic of China(Taiwan), which is the official name of Taiwan. The figures are in NTD (New Taiwan Dollar). [This English news story](https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202309120008) published by Focus Taiwan summarized the report. This is more like an introduction for the public. The challenge will be a collective dataset that contains figures from the past years. Also, datasets written in English are difficult to find.
