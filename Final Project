# Short Pitch: After U.S. arms were sold to Taiwan, how many did they send? 

## by Andrew Zi-Qi Fang, Northwestern University

*Why this story is timely now*

Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. noticed that it is still possible for any regime like China to annex Taiwan. During a late September hearing on Defense Cooperation with Taiwan, many of the committee members asked for a faster speed to send the weapons to the island under growing threats from Chinese President Xi. Rep. 


*Anything else important to know*

The U.S. government has approved arms sales to Taiwan over the past three decades. According to the U.S. Department of the State's [latest testimony](https://www.state.gov/house-armed-services-committee-hearing-defense-cooperation-with-taiwan/) on the hearing which the House Armed Services Committee Holds Hearing held, Deputy Mira Rensnick said the Biden administration authorized more than $21 billion in Taiwan arms sales to Congress. 


*What interesting question you want to answer*

Joe Wilson (R-SC) said on the hearing, "For all of the arms sales to Taiwan approved by the Department of State during the Biden administration, it seems that everything continues to be delayed." [A Washington lawmaker](https://www.reuters.com/world/us-lawmaker-says-washington-has-obligation-fulfil-military-sales-backlog-taiwan-2023-09-01/) also pointed out that the U.S. had an obligation to fill its backlog of arms sales to Taiwan. 

American military support to the Asian ally often considered done when the Capitol approved the bill. However, transfering the arms requires a long waiting for years, which might be difiicult to cope with the urgent need among the tensions across the Taiwan Strait. 

In the story I am pitching, I will display the timeline of the U.S. arm sales to Taiwan and illustrate the pace of each administration on the action. 


*What data may be available (or how you could collect your own dataset) to help you answer it*

While the arms sales bill are considered open to the public as other bills passed by the House and the Senate, the exact time when the U.S. manufacturer transfered the arms reqiures futher matching process to made. For the records obtains in the Washington, Department of State disclose those figures on [their website](https://www.state.gov/fiscal-year-2022-u-s-arms-transfers-and-defense-trade/) every fiscal year. 

On Taipei's side, official records from the [Minitry of National Defense](https://www.mnd.gov.tw/english/) can be collected. I will also trace down the stories on the transitions in the past from Taiwanese officail news outlets like the [Military News Agency](https://mna.gpwb.gov.tw/en/) and [Central News Agency](https://focustaiwan.tw/). 

The following websites or organizations also keep track on the arms sales made by U.S. 

* [Forum on the Arm Trade](https://www.forumarmstrade.org/)
* [Stockholm International Peace Research Institue](https://www.sipri.org/)
* [Counsil on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/podcasts/cost-us-arms-trade)

  
*What types of people you could talk to for sources*

My beat covering over the Capitol for my graduate program is focusing on national defense issues. I can access to both officials and think tanks in Washington, DC. Here are some possible sources: 

* [House Armed Service Committee](https://armedservices.house.gov/)
* [Senate Committee on Armed Service](https://www.armed-services.senate.gov/)
* Members of [House Taiwan Caucus](https://fapa.org/house-taiwan-caucus/)
* Members of [Senate Taiwan Caucus](https://fapa.org/senate-taiwan-caucus/)

# Assignment 2: What's out there | Story research
## What has already been done? 

My story pitch is about the slow-paced transfer of Washington's arms sales to Taiwan. Some of the news stories pointed out this problem but made no further tracking. 

* Washington Post: [Taiwan frustrated by weapons delays, key lawmaker finds in stealth visit](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/02/22/taiwan-weapons-china-gallagher/)
* Defense News: [Taiwan is buying US weapons, but Washington isn‚Äôt delivering them](https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2022/08/25/chinas-neighbors-are-buying-us-weapons-washington-isnt-delivering/)

Some of the stories pointed out that the delay was caused by contractors including Lockheed Martin and Raytheon Technologies Corp (RTX). 

* Wall Street Journal: [U.S. Effort to Arm Taiwan Faces New Challenge With Ukraine Conflict](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-effort-to-arm-taiwan-faces-new-challenge-with-ukraine-conflict-11669559116)
* Defense News: [Slow arms deliveries to Taiwan blamed on US production bottlenecks](https://www.defensenews.com/pentagon/2023/02/24/slow-arms-deliveries-to-taiwan-blamed-on-us-production-bottlenecks/)

This explanation fits what Mira Resnick, a deputy assistant secretary of the Department of State, said in a September hearing. When congressmen asked about the delay in this hearing, Resnick claimed that the contractors caused the delay and that all they could do was push the pace. 

* The page of the hearing from the House Armed Services Committee [Full Committee Hearing: ‚ÄúDefense Cooperation with Taiwan‚Äù](https://armedservices.house.gov/hearings/full-committee-hearing-defense-cooperation-taiwan)
* Mira Resnick's report for the hearing [House Armed Services Committee Hearing: Defense Cooperation with Taiwan](https://www.state.gov/house-armed-services-committee-hearing-defense-cooperation-with-taiwan/)

By the way, the latest policy made by Washington was this bill. It authorized the President's power to aid Taiwan. This bill is also the reason why some American news outlets found it newsworthy. 

* The latest bill passed by the Congress about arms sales to Taiwan [H.R.7776 - James M. Inhofe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2023](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/7776/text)

Overall, there is not much coverage with data or visualized information on the issue. I expect a rare chance to repeat what others have done. On the flip side, there might be a few pieces of information I can reach out to easily. 

As for Taipei's updates about the transfer of arms they purchased from the U.S., there isn't collective data or reports made by the officials. I viewed some Taipei think tanks I know but found a few clues. However, since it is rare and slow for American contractors and Washington to deliver the weapons,  I expect that I can track each of the deliveries at least in the past five to seven years. 

The Taiwanese government expanded its budget for military purchasing from foreign countries. I still find the story newsworthy.

## Three high-quality datasets

This report might not be specific, but it provides an overview of the proportion of the Department of State's funding to foreign countries. The figures are relevant to my pitch about Taiwan were categorized under "East Asia and Pacific" and mostly did not specify Taiwan. An [Op-Ed](https://www.aei.org/op-eds/send-more-aid-to-taiwan-before-its-too-late/) of the think tank AEI pointed out that "Just 2 percent of the State Department‚Äôs most recent FMF budget request was for East Asia and the Pacific. FMF funding for Taiwan should reflect its status as a critical partner in our primary theater and threatened by our pacing adversary."

# Assignment 3: Cleaning data

* Any steps you need to take to clean it

1. The Foreign Military Finance (FMF) sheet was embedded in a pdf. I copied the text and figures to a .xlsx file on my desktop and made it into an Excel version.
2. I removed the summary of each region, such as "Asia" and "East Asia and Pacific" etc.
3. I used a sort to rank each national or sector by the "FY 2020 Actual". I also marked "State East Asia and Pacific Regional" with red text because this sector might include arms sale to Taiwan.
4. I sorted by "State East Asia and Pacific Regional ".

* What is the interesting question you are answering?

1. Which country or area the U.S. spent the most in fiscal year 2020?
2. Among the spending, how much did Washington spend on Taiwan in fiscal year 2020?
3. Who demands the most funding for fiscal year 2022? 

* What is the answer to the question?

1. Israel.
2. 32,000 thousands. It was less than Egypt, Jordan, Ukraine and the Philippines.
3. Israel. The ranking basically did not change. 
This annual report lays out the budget for purchasing arms from the United States. ROC refers to the Republic of China(Taiwan), which is the official name of Taiwan. The figures are in NTD (New Taiwan Dollar). [This English news story](https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202309120008) published by Focus Taiwan summarized the report. This is more like an introduction for the public. The challenge will be a collective dataset that contains figures from the past years. Also, datasets written in English are difficult to find.
