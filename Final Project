# Final Project: Can the US support Taiwan with enough arms before Xi’s ambition? 

*by Andrew Zi-Qi Fang, Northwestern University*

## Introduction (nut graph)

From Israel to Ukraine, the standpoint of the United States became controversial yet critical. Besides the discussion and debate over how many arms Washington *should* aid to its allies, reviews on how many arms *should have been* delivered are impacting the Capitol and White House's future strategy. 

It includes Taiwan. With Taiwan’s coming in January 2024, an unstable scenario like the unification of Crimea in 2014 is haunting Taipei and Washington. 

Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. noticed that it is still possible for any regime like China to annex Taiwan. During a late September hearing on Defense Cooperation with Taiwan, many of the committee members asked for a faster speed to send the weapons to the island under growing threats from Chinese President Xi.

The Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States published its [2023 report](https://armedservices.house.gov/sites/republicans.armedservices.house.gov/files/Strategic-Posture-Committee-Report-Final.pdf) on October. According to its projection, China is increasing its nuclear arms, so the U.S. should deter Beijing’s ambition by supporting Taiwan, a de facto independent island that is facing threats to be annexed by the Chinese regime as soon as 2035. 

Joe Wilson (R-SC) said on the hearing, "For all of the arms sales to Taiwan approved by the Department of State during the Biden administration, it seems that everything continues to be delayed." [A Washington lawmaker](https://www.reuters.com/world/us-lawmaker-says-washington-has-obligation-fulfil-military-sales-backlog-taiwan-2023-09-01/) also pointed out that the U.S. had an obligation to fill its backlog of arms sales to Taiwan. 

American military support to the Asian ally was often considered done when the Capitol approved the bill. However, transferring the arms requires a long wait of years, which might make it difficult to cope with the urgent need among the tensions across the Taiwan Strait. 


## Data

While the arms sales bill is considered open to the public as other bills passed by the House and the Senate, the exact time when the U.S. manufacturer transferred the arms requires a further matching process to be made. The records obtained by the Washington, Department of State disclose those figures on [their website](https://www.state.gov/fiscal-year-2022-u-s-arms-transfers-and-defense-trade/) every fiscal year. 

The latest data published by the Department of State is the Foreign Military Finance record between fiscal year 2020 and 2022. On Page 159 of [Congressional Budget Justification, Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs(FMF)](https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/FY-2022-State_USAID-Congressional-Budget-Justification.pdf). 

This report sorted the spending by countries or continents. The aid toward Taiwan is included in “State East Asia and Pacific Regional” which is under the sum of “East Asia and Pacific.” The way that the Department of State sorted its funds affects the way I visualize the data. Since many of the items are sorted as a region of fund for particular usage, a *map* is not a proper format to show the FMF.

First, the above chart shows that most of the FMF was spent in the Near East, which refers to the Middle East, including Israel, and North African countries such as Morocco and Tunisia. With this overview, readers can immediately realize that the FMF didn’t go to allies besides China and Russia. 

Although the situation did not change dramatically from fiscal year 2020 to 2022, there are several new items showing up. 

After *cleaning up* the sums and other irrelevant items, I *sorted* the dataset to the ranking of the fiscal year. Other than the staggering amount of finance toward Israel, Washington added a new fund named “Countering PRC Malign Influence Fund” with 50,000 thousand. If this is added up with “State East Asia and Pacific Regional”, the number will be 100,000 thousand.

## Limits

During my attempts to dig in more data, I found that there are several limits within the data provided by the Department of State: 

1.	Items that include Taiwan cannot be specified as the fund only for Taiwan. 
2.	Thus, the trend of increasing or decreasing the aid for Taiwan is difficult to show. 
3.	The future funding cannot be predicted over a year ahead. 

Given more time for this story, datasets like the reports of the House and Senate  

Also, datasets written in English are difficult to find. This story will require heavy translating from Traditional Chinese to English to finish.If given more time to translate, there are some possible datasets to illustrate further the path of delivering the arms that are sold to Taiwan. 

The official records from the [Minitry of National Defense](https://www.mnd.gov.tw/english/) can be collected. I will also trace down the stories on the transitions in the past from Taiwanese officail news outlets like the [Military News Agency](https://mna.gpwb.gov.tw/en/) and [Central News Agency](https://focustaiwan.tw/). 

This annual report lays out the budget for purchasing arms from the United States. ROC refers to the Republic of China(Taiwan), which is the official name of Taiwan. The figures are in NTD (New Taiwan Dollar). [This English news story](https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202309120008) published by Focus Taiwan summarized the report. This is more like an introduction for the public. The challenge will be a collective dataset that contains figures from the past years. 


## Structure 

With some limits of the data I found, the story is still possible by combining quantitative and qualitative research. 

With the FMF figures provided by the Department of State, the story can showcase the overview of America’s support over the past few years. The disadvantages of sorting actually reflect the awkward situation of selling arms to Taiwan. Historical background should be included in this story to describe it better. 

For example, the One China Policy was the basis of the States’ standpoint toward its actions toward the Taiwan Straits after Washington switched its recognition of China from Taipei, Republic of China (ROC), to Beijing, People’s Republic of China (PRC), in 1979. On the other hand, the Taiwan Relation Act affirms that the U.S. will continue to sell arms to Taiwan to deter or protect itself from China’s possible attack. 

As for the delivery lag issues, qualitative research is a better way to approach it. Some of the stories pointed out that the delay was caused by contractors including Lockheed Martin and Raytheon Technologies Corp (RTX). 

This explanation fits what Mira Resnick, a deputy assistant secretary of the Department of State, said in a September hearing. When congressmen asked about the delay in this hearing, Resnick claimed that the contractors caused the delay and that all they could do was push the pace. 

As for Taipei's updates about the transfer of arms they purchased from the U.S., there isn't collective data or reports made by the officials. I viewed some Taipei think tanks I know but found a few clues. However, since it is rare and slow for American contractors and Washington to deliver the weapons, I expect to track each of the deliveries for at least the past five to seven years. 

Further discussion can be done by interviewing key members of the Capitol.

This report might not be specific, but it provides an overview of the proportion of the Department of State's funding to foreign countries. The figures are relevant to my pitch about Taiwan were categorized under "East Asia and Pacific" and mostly did not specify Taiwan. An [Op-Ed](https://www.aei.org/op-eds/send-more-aid-to-taiwan-before-its-too-late/) of the think tank AEI pointed out that "Just 2 percent of the State Department’s most recent FMF budget request was for East Asia and the Pacific. FMF funding for Taiwan should reflect its status as a critical partner in our primary theater and threatened by our pacing adversary."
