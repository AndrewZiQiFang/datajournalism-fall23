Critique on [The Texas Tribune's story](https://www.texastribune.org/2019/12/09/how-many-people-are-homeless-texas-least-25000/) on homeless Texans.

### Clarity and accuracy

* Were you able to immediately identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate? Answer on a 1-5 scale, with 5 being excellent and 1 being below expectations. *Ans: 4*
   * What was it? *Ans: Charts on the homeless population around major cities of Texas and how many of them accessed service and housing.* 
   * Was it in the headline? *Ans: Its headline did not mention the visualized content.*
* If there was a data visualization, were you able to understand how to read it? Again, use a 5-point scale with 5 = excellent *Ans: 4*
   * Was that the most efficient way to navigate the visualization? *Ans: Yes* 
   * Can you suggest ways to improve navigation? *Ans: Maybe put the charts upward so readers can find it more easily.*
* Using your own knowledge and critical thinking abilities, do you think the data was accurate? 1-5, with 5 most accurate *Ans: Yes*
   * List any areas where you question the accuracy of the data. *Ans: For the second chart, it would be nice if readers could see the exact number when they click on the columns.*
   * List sources you would suggest the reporter check with. *Ans: The quote from Ana Rausch mentioned that 76% of the people don't come back for services. I wonder how they calculate the exact number 76%.*
   * Did they provide a source? *Ans: No*
   * Did they explain everything that needed explaining? *Ans: No*

### Quality

* Regardless of the form that the graphic/story takes, was it executed at a high degree of quality? (Rank 1-5, with five excellent.) *Ans: 4*
   * Explain what they did well and areas where improvements could be made. *Ans: The charts are kept in simple colors like yellow and grey, which fit the color of its website and make it easy to read. The charts are not perfect and creative enough but contain few errors or problems.*

### Type and color (if piece includes graphics)

* Based on your knowledge of color and type use, did this person use type (as in typography, fonts) and color to their best purpose?
   * For example, did it: 
       * Look like it all belonged together? *Ans: Yes*
       * Draw your eye first to the most important pieces of information? *Ans: No*
       * Make sense? For example, if it discussed heat, did it use the color red to communicate the degree of heat rather than, say, blue? *Ans: I hope the color can be more flexible, such as using lighter or darker yellow.*
* Type (1-5) *Ans: 5*
   * Explain *Ans: It's neat and easy to read.*
* Color (1-5) *Ans: 3*
   * Explain *Ans: Lack of contrast.*
   
### Creativity

* Did the piece use some creative elements to good effect? As in, to emphasize those areas that could draw someone in, or to add detail where needed, but not just random visual or story junk that distracts you? *Ans: No*
   * How? *Ans: The charts are locked in pictures and are not interactive.*
   * Rate effectiveness on scale of 1-5. *Ans: 2*
