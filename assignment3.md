* Any steps you need to take to clean it

1. The Foreign Military Finance (FMF) sheet was embedded in a pdf. I copied the text and figures to a .xlsx file on my desktop and made it into an Excel version.
2. I removed the summary of each region, such as "Asia" and "East Asia and Pacific" etc.
3. I used a sort to rank each national or sector by the "FY 2020 Actual". I also marked "State East Asia and Pacific Regional" with red text because this sector might include arms sale to Taiwan.
4. I sorted by "State East Asia and Pacific Regional ".

* What is the interesting question you are answering?

1. Which country or area the U.S. spent the most in fiscal year 2020?
2. Among the spending, how much did Washington spend on Taiwan in fiscal year 2020?
3. Who demands the most funding for fiscal year 2022? 

* What is the answer to the question?

1. Israel.
2. 32,000 thousands. It was less than Egypt, Jordan, Ukraine and the Philippines.
3. Israel. The ranking basically did not change.
